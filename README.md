Readme

#This is the readme for the miniature SEO Analyzer program developed as an exercise

#Concerns
1. While developing the program
  - create the list of stop-words for the filter
  - detecting the external URL
  - extracting words from an URL
2. Upon completing the program
  -

#Decisions
- To use either text file to store or just put the stop-words in an array

#Guiding
1. The first page is SEO_main where the user is asked to enter either the URL or the text to be analyzed
2. The user is also required to pick at least 1 of the 4 functions. A note on the function
  - Picking 1 will affect the result of 2 and 3
3. The system will process the text/URL and return the desired results in a table format (for function 1 to 3)

#Testing
5 long text and 5 URL for testing
  - Will be included in another note
